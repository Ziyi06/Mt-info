# Mt-info

This module calculates basic mountain parameters such as average mountain length, width, elevation, Moho depth and erosion rate 
for three modern collisional mountains, the Himalaya-Tibetan plateau, Alps and Zagros.

The shapes of mountain ranges are from Natural Earthâ€™s physical vectors (version 4.1.0; http://naturalearthdata.com).
Global topography data from ETOPO1, https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/etopo-global-relief-model) at a spatial resolution of one arc-minute (Amante and Eakins, 2009).
Global Moho depth data are from CRUST1.0, https://igppweb.ucsd.edu/~gabi/ crust1.html), at one-degree resolution (Laske et al., 2013).
